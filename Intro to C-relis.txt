| Hi, my name is C-relis. I'm a new programming language.

| With me you can create and use numerical variables called 'tiv's, they even can contain floating-point numbers.
| Just declare a new variable typing 'tiv' at the beginning of the line, then type the name of the variable,
| then use this '<-' operator for assigning the value of the right side to your variable, for example: 'tiv MyTiv <- 512'.
| Change the value of the variable simply using the same logic without typing 'tiv' at the beginning, for example: 'MyTiv <- 1024'.
| If you've already declared a variable without assigning a value to it, it will receive a value of 0 by default.

| With me you can also make arithmetical operations and assign the result to a variable,
| for example: 'tiv a <- 512', 'tiv b <- a * 2'.
| CAUTION! Make arithmetical operations only with 2 operands!

| If you want to print a text or the value of a declared variable, just type 'tpi' at the beginning of the line,
| then use square brackets if you want to print a text, or use curly brackets for printing the value of a variable,
| for example: 'tpi [Hello World!]', 'tpi {MyTiv}'.
| Type ':' RIGHT AFTER the brackets if you want to end the line, for example: 'tpi [Hello World!]:', 'tpi {MyTiv}:'.
| For leaving the line empty just type 'tpi []:' or 'tpi {}:'.

| If you want to operate or omit statements if a certain condition is true or false, just type 'xosqi yete' at the beginning,
| then use square brackets for checking the condition, for example 'xosqi yete [MyTiv M 25]'.
| Don't forget to type the operands and the brackets RIGHT AFTER each other as in the example above.
| NOTE! 'M' means "greater than",          'P' means "less than",          'H' means "equal to",
|       'MH' means "greater or equal to",  'PH' means "less or equal to",  'AH' means "not equal to".
| DON'T FORGET to use '>' at the end of the statement, until which you want to operate or omit, otherwise all subsequent
| statements will be operated or omited.

| With me you can also create loops. Just type 'mti fra' at the beginning of the line, then use a condition as described above,
| for example: 'mti fra [MyTiv PH a]'.
| DON'T FORGET to use '>' at the end of the statement, until which you want to iterate or omit, otherwise the loop will
| never end if the condition is true or the execution will end if the condition is false.
| RECOMMENDED! Be careful to the condition of a loop, if it's true and never changes during the iteration,
| the loop will never end.

| Use '|' for your comments in the line. If it's used after a space or at the beginning of the line, the interpreter
| will omit its continuation besides when it's used in the text to be printed, for example: 'tpi [Hello |World]'.

| NOTE! You can use as much spaces instead of only one as you want,
| for example: '  mti  fra    [a   M  b] ', '    a   <-  10     >   |    comment   '.

| FINAL NOTE! I'm a case-sensisive language, so be careful when typing,
| but DON'T WORRY, you'll be informed about the errors and their lines.

| Feel free to interpret even this text file. It must print 'Hello World!'.
